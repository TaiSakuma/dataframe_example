This directory contains a set of files that demonstrate a simple example of analysis with data frame. It contains two data frames each in a text file and one Python script.


#### How to check out and run the scripts

Check out this repo:

    git clone git@github.com:TaiSakuma/dataframe_example.git

Move to this directory, the directory in which this `README.md` file is:

    cd dataframe_example/

Run the Python script

    ./yield.py

It will create the output file `tbl_yield_process.txt`.
